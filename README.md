Androclick: a small Android app for bus times in Naples
=
Androclick lets you to know how may time you have to wait for a certain bus, if the bus line and the stop are both served by the GPS service.

General info
-
Androclick allows you to check for a bus stop timing just by entering the number of that stop. In the service is active, the application will return the user some useful info about buses.
Moreover, the user can look for the list of all the stops in a certain street or on a certain line.

The underlying service is available at http://www.anm.it/. It is quite unstable, so it represents the actual bottleneck of the entire system.
